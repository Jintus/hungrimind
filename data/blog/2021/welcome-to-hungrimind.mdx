We love learning. We love sharing. We love making. And even though there are a ton of awesome resources online, there is not a centralized place, a go-to place, to learn about how stuff in this world works, and how to use that knowledge to create something awesome. I use the word `stuff` here on purpose, because for me creativity and curiosity is not limited to any one thing.

This is what Hungrimind sets out to be. A central place, where you can learn about various topics within both the physical and digital world, and feed your curiosity. A wikipedia for creators.

This will take years of building out the content, and improving the experience on the site, but eventually we hope Hungrimind will be the place for DIYers, builders, makers, creators to have a resource for learning new things and be able to use what they learned in simple to follow project guides.

Welcome to Hungrimind!
