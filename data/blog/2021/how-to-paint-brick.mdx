## Materials and Tools you will need:

1. Safety equipment (goggles, gloves and mask)
2. Wire scrub brush
3. Soap
4. Pressure washer (if applicable)
5. Plastic drop cloth
6. Painters tape
7. Paint brush
8. Roller with thick nap
9. Paint sprayer

## Step 1: Clean and prepare the brick.

It is essential not to skip the cleaning step no matter how tedious it may seem. Failing to clean properly before hand will result in dust and other debris stopping the paint from adhering.

Interior: Use soapy water and a wire brush.
Exterior: Use a pressure washer.

You may encounter mold or mildew while cleaning. In this case, apply a solution of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water. After letting it soak for 30 minutes to 1 hour, then scrub the affected area with your wire brush.

Let the brick dry for at least 24 hours. Once the brick is dry, it is time to tape off any sections that will not be painted.

> Note: Once the brick is clean, inspect the brick for any signs of damage and take appropriate measures. Smaller cracks may only require acrylic caulk while larger issues may require repointing(repairing) the brick.

## Step 2: Choosing painting tools.

Small area: Brush or roller.
Large area: Paint sprayer.

> Note: when choosing your roller make sure the nap is between 20-32 mm in order to cover the nooks and crannies better.

## Step 3: Apply the primer.

Before applying paint to the brick, it is essential to apply a primer that is specially formulated to adhere to brick. Apply one to two coats and allow it to dry for at least 24 hours.

## Step 4: Pick your paint.

Once you've used a primer that is specially formulated to adhere to brick it is okay to use regular acrylic latex paint. Many experts recommend gloss or semi-gloss paint as it is easier to clean in the future.

> Note: It is very important to to buy exterior paint when painting exterior brickwork as it will stand against mildew and evaporate moisture.

## Alternative options

Limewash is when you use paint made with lime to change the color of the brick. Limewash is absorbed into the brick and allows you to keep the original texture.
