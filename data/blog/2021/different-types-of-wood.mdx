I love how some of the things you would think are very straight forward, actually have a lot of complexities behind them. In this case we’re taking a deeper look at wood. Specifically wood used for building things.

There are 2 different types of wood

- Hardwood
- Softwood

> Fun Fact: The words hard and soft in this case have NO correlation to how “hard” or “soft” the wood is.

The technical term for hardwood is `angiosperm` and softwood is `gymnosperm`. The way you can tell these trees apart is by the types of seeds they create. Hardwood has seeds which are enclosed within a protective barrier like a fruit or an acorn, while softwood has seeds that are unenclosed and open to the elements. Softwood are mostly conifer trees like pine cones.

Even though there is no correlation to the woods softness, hardwoods are on average _harder_ than softwoods.

When using wood for building, there are 3 main types of materials you will work with

- Solid Wood
- Plywood
- Composites

## Solid Wood

These are solid pieces of wood cut directly from a tree. The most common types are spruce, pine and fir tree. These are what most 2x4 and 2x6 are made from.

Solid woods can be cut in various “grains” which result in different patterns on the wood piece, as well as different resistance to movement. Plain sawn is the cheapest wood, and results in the least waste, but it is the most susceptible to movement. Part of the reason for this is because the grain of the plank is around the heart of the tree which has tension. The quarter sawn is stronger, but produces more waste so it’s more expensive. Lastly, the rift sawn is the strongest and produces the most waste so it is the most expensive.

When using solid wood it is important to take the moisture content and potential movement into account. There will usually be a stamp on your wood. If you see KN - HT that means kiln dried and heat treated, which means the wood will have a lower moisture content and will be less susceptible to change shape. If you see AD or S-GRN that means air dried or surface green, which means your wood has a much higher moisture content and is a lot more susceptible to movement.

Interesting article about wood moisture: [Wood Movements](https://workshopcompanion.com/KnowHow/Design/Nature_of_Wood/2_Wood_Movement/2_Wood_Movement.htm)

There are 4 main ways that wood can move whether it is due to the way it was cut or due to the moisture content.

- Bow - bends against the wide side of the plank
- Crown/Crook - bends against the narrow side of the plank
- Twist - rotate, usually around a heart center
- Cup - a wide board which makes it into a U shape

## Plywood

Plywood is made from thin sheets of wood that are glued together. They are most commonly cut using a rotary cut, which cuts a circle out of the wood piece. This allows for plywood to have much wider planks of wood than solid wood cuts. When these sheets are glued together they are glued in opposite grains which decreases the amount the wood can move. The negative of plywood is it is not nearly as strong as solid wood.

## Composites

MDF, OSB, and fiberboard are the most common building composites. These materials might not even have any wood in it. They are very cheap, and good to use for places that won’t be seen or for a cheap project that doesn’t have much load. The benefit of composites is that there is little to no movement of the boards, however it is not as strong as even plywood.

Another big negative is both plywood and composites should not get wet. Water will ruin these materials. Plywood could be used as long as the edges are protected.
