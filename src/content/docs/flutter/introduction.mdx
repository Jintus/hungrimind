title: What is Hungrimind?
description: Introduction to Hungrimind
---

My name is Tadas, and I'm a creator on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@tadaspetra). I love creating educational videos, but there is some real **BIG** issues with educational YouTube videos. 

## The Problem 
Once they are released, videos are not:

- Editable
- Searchable
- Accountable
- Structured

Which leads to comments like these:
<div>
  <img src="/introduction/comment2.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: 3rem" alt="YouTube comment saying to update the video" />
  <img src="/introduction/comment1.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: 3rem" alt="YouTube comment saying video is outdated"/>
</div>

### Problems with Tutorials on YouTube
* When there is a new software release, all your content becomes out of date. 
* Even though the YouTube algorithm is pretty good, searching for a small, specific concept within a video is hard. 
* If you make a mistake, it is reeaaallly hard to fix it.
* And yes, YouTube has chapters and playlists, but it would be nice to structure it exactly how I want.

## The Solution
This is what Hungrimind was built for! I want this to be the best place for people to learn Flutter, and you can be sure that the content here is accurate and up to date. 

Each page has an "Edit this page" button that leads to GitHub to flag a problem, update wording, or offer a suggestion. And there is a whole community, including me, ready to fix it up.

Videos will be embedded within the blogs, and while new videos might be created on [Hungrimind Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@hungrimind), this site will be the source of truth and only the up to date videos will be shown here.

You can sign up to the newsletter and receive emails every time a new doc is launched!

This is going to be a long and big project, but I hope and believe that it will become the best resource for learning that will change people's lives.

LFG,
Tadas ðŸ’™
