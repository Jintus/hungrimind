title: What is Hungrimind?
description: Introduction to Hungrimind

I'm a creator on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@tadaspetra) and I love creating educational videos, but there is some real **BIG** issues with creating educational YouTube videos. Once they are released videos are not

- Editable
- Searchable
- Accountable
- Structured

When there is a new software release, all your content becomes out of date. Even though the YouTube algorithm is pretty good, searching for a very specific thing within a video is hard. If you make a mistake, you might get called out in the comments, but it might not get noticed, and even if it gets noticed it's hard to fix it. And yes, YouTube has chapters and playlists, but it would be nice to structure it exactly how I want.

Sorry for that rant, but that's what Hungrimind was built for! I want this to be the best place for people to learn Flutter, and you can be sure that the content here is accurate, up to date. Each page has an "Edit this page" button that leads to GitHub to flag a problem, update wording, or offer a suggestion and there is a whole community including me ready to fix it up.

Videos will be embedded along with the blogs, and while new videos might be created on [Hungrimind Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@hungrimind), this site will be the source of truth and only the up to date videos will be shown here.

This is going to be a long and big project, but I hope and believe that it will become the best resource for learning that will change people's lives.

LFG,
Tadas ðŸ’™
