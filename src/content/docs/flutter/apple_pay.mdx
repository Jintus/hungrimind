description: Tutorial on how to set up apple pay for your Flutter application

You know what is fun about building applications? Making money with them. One way to do that is to accept payments within the application.

Apple Pay is the most seamless way for people using iOS devices to pay for something. 

## Setup
You will need an Apple Developer account for this.

### 1. Register an App ID
Go to `Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles` section on the Apple developer portal, select `Identifiers` and make sure you are on the `App IDs` filter.

Click the blue plus icon, to add a new App ID, select the `App IDs` option, and an app type. Once you get to the below screen, it's very important that you put the same exact bundle identifier as the bundle identifier on the actual app you're building (you can find it in XCode). Specifically for implementing Apple Pay, you need to select the `Apple Payment Processing` option.

### 2. Create a Merchant ID
After you register it will lead you back to the `Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles` page where you should switch to the `Merchant IDs` filter.

And once again, click the blue plus icon to create a new Merchant ID. Make sure the `Merchant IDs` option is selected and you'll be taken to the registration screen. This time you can choose whatever identifier you want, but it is recommended to follow Apple's convention.

### 3. Create a Apple Pay Processing Certificate
For the certificate, you need to switch to the `Certificates` and once again click the blue plus icon. Under `Services` select the `Apple Pay Payment Processing Certificate`, select the `Merchant ID` we just created and it will lead you to this screen, where you will need to a create the certificate.

### 4. Create a CSR for certificate
Once you have clicked the button highlighted above, you will need to upload a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file from your Mac. To do this you need to open the `Keychain Access` application which should be installed on your Mac by default.

In the toolbar select `Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority` and you should see the below screen. Add you email, name, select `Saved to disk` and `Let me specify key pair information`.

Click continue and for the key pair information change `Algorithm` to `ECC` and `Key Size` to `256 bits`

This will save a CSR file to your specified location.

Upload it to our `Apple Pay Processing Certificate`.

### 5. Add apple pay ability in XCode Project
Now this last part is a bit easier. Open up your XCode project, select `Runner` and then `Signing & Capabilities`.

Select `Apple Pay` and choose the `Merchant ID` that corresponds with this project.

> **Note:** The `Bundle Identifier` for this specific project must be a registered App ID on the apple developer site. That was what we did in <a href="#1-register-an-app-id">Step #1</a>, so make sure that's the same app, or redo step #1 for this specific app.


## What is a Merchant ID and Certificate?
What the heck did we just even do? In order to be able to accept payments you need to have an Apple Developer account and be a "verified" merchant able to accept payments. The Payment Processing Certificate is tied directly to that Merchant ID, and is used for encrypting the payment data that is being sent. The Apple Pay servers use the certificate to encrypt that payment data, and then your payment service provide can use it to decrpyt that data. So all of this was done in the name of security.

## Add it to your Flutter App
The first thing you will need is to add the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/pay" target="_blank">`pay`</a> package to your flutter application. You will need to create an apple pay configuration. 

You can find an example default configuration <a href="https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/blob/main/pay/example/lib/payment_configurations.dart#L27" target="_blank">here</a>. To get this configuration working you need to update the `merchantIdentifier` and `displayName` to the Merchant Identifiers we set up in <a href="#2-create-a-merchant-id">Step #2</a>. You can find the complete list of parameters on the  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentrequest" target="_blank">Apple Pay Documentation</a>.

And the very last step is to add the Apple Pay button that is provided by the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/pay" target="_blank">`pay`</a> package to your application. Here is a basic one, but check out the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/pay" target="_blank">`pay`</a> package for more details.

```dart
ApplePayButton(
    paymentConfiguration: PaymentConfiguration.fromJsonString(defaultApplePay),
    paymentItems: const [
        PaymentItem(
            label: 'Total',
            amount: '0.01',
            status: PaymentItemStatus.final_price,
        )
    ],
    style: ApplePayButtonStyle.black,
    type: ApplePayButtonType.book,
    onPaymentResult: (result) {
        //add what you want to happen after purchase is made
    },
    loadingIndicator: const Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    ),
),
```
