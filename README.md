Hungrimind is a learning hub for exploring various topics for people with a hungry mind. ðŸ˜‰

It's like a blog except

- Structured
- Update-able
- Searchable

Over time, this will become the go-to place where you can learn something new. This is a big goal, that will probably take years to implement (fyi: today is Dec 1st 2022). 

It will begin with a smaller goal of becoming the best place to learn [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). It is not meant to replace the docs. The docs will cover the nitty gritty details, while hungrimind will take you down a pathway of learning concepts and building projects.
